Firebase
- Enable auth
  - Email/password login
  - Authed domain is app.stage.accountsmachine.io or whatever.
  - Delete localhost (except for on dev, we use localhost).
  - Mess with templates settings
- APIs and credentials, firebase has created an app key, put the key
  in environment...ts in the web app.
- Configure OAUTH consent screen (not needed?).

console.cloud.google.com
- Point app.stage.accountsmachine.io or whatever to ghs.googlehosted.com
- Point api.stage.accountsmachine.io or whatever to ghs.googlehosted.com

For project...
- Create service account

  make create-service-account KIND=prod

push image

run-deploy
run-upgrade

NOTE!!! Must have <app-name>.firebaseapp.com in API key HTTP referers for
email verification links to work.
